### TODO
* Exclude `Year` and `Country` and `Status`
  - [ ] Use VIP to reduce descriptors
  - [ ] MLR after reducing descriptors
  - [ ] SVR
  - [ ] Random Forest Regression
  - [ ] Ridge Regression
  - [ ] Lasso Regression
  - [ ] Others

* Analyze by separated `Year`
  - [ ] MLR
  - [ ] SVR
  - [ ] Random Forest Regression
  - [ ] Ridge Regression
  - [ ] Lasso Regression
  - [ ] Others

* Anaylyze between `Developed` and `Developping` countries
